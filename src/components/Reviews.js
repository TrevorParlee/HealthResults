When I first met Michelle I had no interest in Acupuncture as I was completely scared of needles! Looking back now, I realized there was no need to have this emotion at all.  Michelle is the most caring individual I have ever met.  She truly makes you feel comfortable and will never do anything that you are  not sure of, but she will absolutely go out of her way to research everything about your certain situation and incorporate different options in your treatment with the ultimate goal of getting you back to 100%.  Without a doubt you need to see Michelle."`}
